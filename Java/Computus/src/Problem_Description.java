Computus
From wikipedia:
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus)
“Computus 
(Latin for computation) is the calculation of the date of Easter in the Christian
calendar.
The name has been used for this procedure since the early Middle Ages, as it was one of the
most
important computations of the
age.”
Your task is to write a JAVA class that can calculate the month and day of
Easter
when given a year in the Gregorian
calen
dar.
The difficulty of this problem varies based on the parts you complete, but you
may 
only count it once (easy OR medium OR
hard).
Easy
:
Implement the Meeus/Jones/Butcher Gregorian
algorithm
(
http
://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus)
to calculate the date of Easter.
Your
program should take a command‐line user input of the year and output the
date 
Easter did or will
occur.
Example
:
Enter Year:
2008
Hint
:
Easter: March 23,
2008
Later parts of this assignment will be easier if you have a constructor like
the
following:
Easter e = new
Easter(2008);
Medium:
Complete the easy problem
and:
The  order of the dates of Easter will repeat  every 5,700,000 years. 
Make a
program
that will calculate the dates of Easter over an entire cycle, and display the number
of
times Easter occurred on each calendar
day.
Example
:
March 22 ‐
27550
March 23 ‐ 
54150
...
April 25 ‐
42000
Hard:
Complete the easy problem,
medium problem
and:
A piece of software is only as good as the testing that has been done to validate
it. 
Testing even a trivial application can be extremely time consuming, and
changes
made to the code can easily introduce new bugs. Therefore industry relies
heavily 
upon automated
testing.
Create an automated testing suite using JUnit (
http://junit.sourceforge.net/
) to
test
your program 
with the know list of Easters from a source other than your
program.
Your list of known dates must contain at least 20 entries, and you MUST site
the
source of your list in your
documentation.

This is a current project that I am working on with Aubrey Yates to create a time keeping website for small business and startups.
This is a web project that is nearing completion, utilizing Javascript, PHP, HTML, etc.

During testing, we viewed these files using xampp. Put all these files in the htdocs folder in xampp after turning on the apache servers. Replace the existing files in that folder.
Then to run the program, open a web browser and go to localhost in the address bar.
